Class Preparation:
==================

Students are expected to read and study the assigned material, per the course
schedule, BEFORE each class.

Scheduling Computer Time
========================

Scheduling of computer time outside of regular lab time is the Student's
responsibility. Availability of computers is NOT an excuse for being late with
a lab project assignment.
