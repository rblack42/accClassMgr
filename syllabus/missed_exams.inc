Missed Exams
============

Missed EXAMS must be made up no later than the next scheduled class period.
Exams can be missed only for extreme circumstances (Example: hospitalization).
Please contact the instructor IN ADVANCE if you will miss one of the exams.
There are NO make up exams for un-excused absences. Only one exam may be taken
as a make up exam.
