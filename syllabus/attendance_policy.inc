Attendance Policy:
==================

For on-campus courses, attendance will be taken during each lecture session.
You are expected to attend classes regularly. If you miss a class, you are
still responsible for any material covered in that class.

For distance classes, attendance points will be assigned based on email
correspondence and on-time homework/lab submissions.
